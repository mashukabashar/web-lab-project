### **After:**
- Each event has only 1 button: DETAILS
- Users must view event details before booking
- Creates a more guided, informative booking process

## Gallery Interface Consistency

All galleries now have identical button structure:
```php
<div style="text-align: center;">
    <a href="event_details.php?type=[event_type]&id=<?php echo $row['id']; ?>" style="display: inline-block;">
        <input type='button' value='DETAILS' class='btn info' style="padding: 8px 16px; font-size: 12px;"/>
    </a>
</div>
```

## Booking Flow

### **New User Journey:**
1. **Browse Gallery** â†’ View events with images, names, and prices
2. **Click DETAILS** â†’ See comprehensive event information
3. **ADD TO CART & BOOK NOW** â†’ Available in event_details.php
4. **Complete Booking** â†’ Through cart system with admin approval

### **Benefits:**
- âœ… Consistent user interface across all event types
- âœ… Users view complete details before booking decisions
- âœ… Reduced impulse bookings, more informed choices
- âœ… Cleaner, less cluttered gallery design
- âœ… Streamlined booking workflow

The booking functionality is still available through the detailed event pages, ensuring users can still complete bookings while encouraging them to review full event information first.
